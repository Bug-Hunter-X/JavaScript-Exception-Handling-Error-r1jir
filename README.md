# JavaScript Exception Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: improper exception handling. The `bug.js` file contains a function that attempts to divide by zero.  The calling function doesn't handle this error, leading to a crash.  The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to handle this exception to prevent application crashes.
